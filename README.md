# Data Science & Artificial Intelligence Projects

This repository contains personal projects developed to strengthen my skills in data analysis, visualisation, and applied machine learning using Python.

The objective of these projects is to build a solid practical foundation in data processing, statistical modelling, and interactive visualisation as preparation for advanced study in Artificial Intelligence.
